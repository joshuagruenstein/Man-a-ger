				<p>NYCSL, or the New York Computer Science League, is a programming competition created for New York high schools students to compete against each-other while solving algorithmic computer science problems.</p>
				<p>Each month at midnight a new challenge is posted.  Programmers in NYCSL have one month to upload as many solutions as they like; only the top score is counted.  Solutions are instantly graded and put up on both global and school-wide leaderboards.  Problems are designed such that they are suitable for programmers of all skill levels; beginners are encouraged to participate.<p>
				<p>Currently the following schools are supported. If you'd like your school to be added, please contact us.
					<ul>
						<li>Horace Mann School</li>
						<li>Riverdale Country School</li>
						<li>Ethical Culture Fieldston School</li>
						<li>Trinity School</li>
						<li>Dalton School</li>
						<li>Stuyvesant High School</li>
						<li>Bronx High School of Science</li>						
					</ul>
